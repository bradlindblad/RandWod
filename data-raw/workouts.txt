This is NOT meant to be done as a straight AMRAP at 75% effort without rest. Take the rest so you can sustain a 90% effort across the entire 26 minutes and really build that engine!, *Theodore Roosevelt was the 26th President of the United States, thus the AMRAP time of 26 minutes. The statue in the demo video is 17 feet tall, thus the rep scheme. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in0nsJaSb6Y

Keep a good pace and continue to move the entire 20 minutes., *Eleanor Roosevelt, 32nd First Lady of the United States, was the first American delegate to the  United Nations.
